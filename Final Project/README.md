#### Abstract

Immigration has been a topic under heated public discussion in American politics.  In particular, research shows that the public holds extremely divided opinion on the topic. We propose to develop a Shiny app that collects and visualizes real-time public sentiment of the Immigration issue on Twitter. To start with, we will create a Twitter APP to gain keys to the API. We use “Search Tweet” APIs to collect information. We analyze the text of the Tweets using Word Cloud, Sentiment Analysis, and Topic Modeling. We also geo-tag the a sample of the retrieved Tweets to understand where the topic of immigration is prevalent. Finally, we create a Shiny App that allows users to input a query term of interest to search for recent Tweets.
